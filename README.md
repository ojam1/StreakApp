# Bloom React Native Development Challenge

## Overview
Design and implement a React Native component to display a 'Workout Streak'. The streak is a continuous string of days where a user successfully completes a workout.

> ℹ️ Please commit often so that we know how you think


**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Streak Component:** Create a component to depict a Workout Streak over a span of 7 days.
2. **Streak Days:** Streak days should always begin from the first day of the the streak, and proceed in a rolling seven-day period (see example scenarios below for the 9day streak).
3. **Current Day Highlight:** Current day should have a border.
4. **'Perfect Week' Display:** On the completion of seven sequential workouts, introduce a 'Perfect Week' status.
    - Show the 'Perfect Week' status on each seventh consecutive day of the streak (i.e., Day 7, 14, 21, 28, etc.).
5. **'Flame' Icon:** When the 'Perfect Week' status is on display, incorporate a 'Flame' icon on the Day Component for each day of that week.

## Project Setup
- Clone the repository.
- Execute `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
- Launch the project with `yarn start`.

# ⭐️ Bonus: Animation Implementation

For bonus points, consider incorporating the following animations:

(Note: You'll need to install necessary dependencies. We recommend using [Moti](https://moti.fyi/) and [React Native Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/))

- Animate the Streak Day Component on the current day.

- On achieving a 'Perfect Week,' animate all Day Components along with the gradient.
